# My UNIX dot files

Here are my standard dot files (.bashrc, .vimrc. .bash_alises, etc...). Feel free to use/change them and if you think you have an improvement to them please send a pull request.

If you do use them then you will need to update the values in `gitsetup.sh`.

Tested in Fedora, CentOS and Ubuntu.
